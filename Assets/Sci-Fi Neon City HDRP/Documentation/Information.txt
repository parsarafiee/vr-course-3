Hello. Thank you for purchasing this asset.
Here is a little help for using the asset.


- Optimizing graphics performance -
By default, all ads banners ( Holograms ) in the scene play the video.
To improve performance, you can disable the video on each ad ( Hologram ).
For example, select an ad banner and simply uncheck the "Video Player" component.
After that, the ad banner will only display the static image.


- Ads -
All advertising banners have groups, for example, one street is one group.
You can easily replace the image or video of each Hologram. 
It is important that the resolution and aspect ratio of the image or video match the size of the banner.


- Lighting -
If you want to change the lighting or add static objects to the scene, I recommend using the following parameters.
Values of all static objects ( except for Ads - holograms ):
Low quality Baked GI: "Scale In Lightmap: 0.005". Quick  Generate Lighting ( draft Version ).
Good quality Baked GI: "Scale In Lightmap: 0.1"
